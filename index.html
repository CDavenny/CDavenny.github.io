  <p>Ever since I picked up a pencil, people have been asking me to draw them things. Eventually I realized that I needed to pursue a future that would harbor my talents. After creating my first t-shirt design in eighth grade I was hooked on graphic design. Now with each new day, I find myself getting better and better with every new project! </p>
